                <p>Hello! My name is Billy i am 26 and i cuurently reside in sunny Conroe, Texas.
                    I currently work as a master window tinter and have been working for my fathers business since i was 12
                    years old. Window tinting can really do a number on ones body and for such a young age i'm already feeling it!
                    That is why i have been seeking a new career path that doesnt involve wear and tear on my body, becoming a
                    full-stack engineer is the path i decided i want to go down and i look forward to constantly learning about 
                    this very interesting subject and line of work.
